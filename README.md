  A journey to sort arrays efficiently.
</p>

## Description
- Push Swap is a sorting algorithm implemented in C. It efficiently sorts a stack of integers using a series of predefined operations.
- The algorithm aims to minimize the number of operations required to sort the stack, achieving an efficient sorting process.

## Implementation
- The push_swap algorithm can be implemented using different data structures such as stacks (Last In First Out) or linked lists. For this project, a doubly linked list data structure is recommended for efficient stack manipulation.
- To get started:
  - Create a doubly linked list structure to represent stack nodes, with each node containing an integer value and pointers to the next and previous nodes.
  - Implement functions for stack initialization, stack operations (push, pop, swap, rotate, and reverse rotate), and stack sorting.
  - For my approach, I implemented a function to calculate the minimum number of moves required to push an element from stack A to stack B. This function will determine the optimal moves to push to stack B during the sorting process before the actual sorting operation begins.

## Sorting Algorithms
- The push_swap algorithm uses different sorting techniques based on the number of elements in the stack:
  - A sorting algorithm based on permutations is used for small stack sizes (typically 3 or less). This involves checking all possible permutations of the stack and determining the minimum number of operations required to sort it.
  - For larger stack sizes, more efficient sorting algorithms such as quicksort or mergesort can be implemented. These algorithms divide the stack into smaller sub-stacks, sort them recursively, and then combine them to achieve the final sorted order.

## Usage
- To compile the push_swap program, run:
  ```
  make
  ```
- To use the push_swap program, provide a series of integers as arguments:
  ```
  ./push_swap <integers>
  ```
  For example:
  ```
  ./push_swap 5 2 7 1 4
  ```
- The program will output a list of operations to sort the input stack. A two/three-letter code represents each operation. The goal is to minimize the number of operations required to sort the stack efficiently.
